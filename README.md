# Kaiku Music Player

"Kaiku" means "echo" in Finnish and it is a music player inspired by Winamp.

Built on top of Electron (Chromium + Node.js), React and Mobx.

## Features

- __Music library__. It will look for songs in your computer and index them.
- __Fast search__. It is pretty fast to find a song, even with huge libraries.
- __Customizable__. Built with CSS and React component, it is easy to customize.

### Planned

- __Get music information from online services__ like last.fm API.
- __Radio mode__. Stream some song to your friends.

## How to get it?

Currently the app must be built on your computer.

## This project history

A brief recap of the why and how this player was built.

### Why it was created

#### Winamp nostalgic

I built the first version of this player at the beginning of 2015 to have an experience similar to the one I had with Winamp. I used that opportunity to learn React and node-webkit.

I have been using Winamp forever.  
I wasn't happy with the players available in the Mac ecosystem. Especially that now everything goes "in the cloud", people have moved to services like Spotify.

#### Listening music through video chat does not work.

I talk music with some friends from time to time.  
We play a song and comment it. Unfortunately it's hard to listen to music through the same channel than a video chat. The sound is badly captured and interrupted if you start speaking.
One goal is that you or your friend could be streaming the song, like a radio. P2P feature, hence the name Kaiku. (echo).

### Open source (mid 2017)

Although not ok for any real product, what I built was just fine for me. So I've been enjoying Kaiku for a long time without developing further.

This isn't yet an end-user ready version. But I've been wanting to publish it for a while.
So I have rewritten the UI with ES6 and mobx and will continue to work on it.

I hope some people will get interested ;)
